Component -> Class, function

                  State, props, Template
				  
				  
				  Props would be usually received from parent component
				  State would be within in the component and it is bound to change
				  Template 
				  
				    Template will usually interpolating props and states
					and hence template code has to be merged with js data
					
					
			First time, a component is instantiated, a Component template is prepared and Rendered on the screen
			it is called Mounting
			
			componentDidMount(){
			
			}
			
			Change in state will trigger Re rendering [ but not automatically
			we have to explicitly call setState]
			
			in case of useState , appropriate set method
			
			componentDidUpdate(){
			
			}
