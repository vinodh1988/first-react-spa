New Model 

SPA 

What needs to be considered

1. ES5 development not sufficient [ we Need language or versions which has advanced features]
2. Unnecassary library code, testing code should not be packed
3. During development the code should be properly readable and maintainable, and the 
environment should support the code maintainance and packaging,testing and running
4. When it comes to production no matter whether it is a simple web page or complex web
page , browser always run javascript ,css and html


Development

   HTML
   CSS - Css, SCSS, LESS
   JS - typescript, jsx, tsx, es2020
   
   server - node based  web server to run and test the application
   
 From development to production
 
  1. convert languages like ts to js
  2. convert es2020,es2019 to es2015
  3. minify the code
  4. test the code
  5. package the code [ bundling- take the opening file , walk through the code
  and referred libraries ,attach only used code and detach un necassary code that
  is never used]
